At least one folder with images has to be selected. 

When you have added some folders, if you click on the camera icon in the status area you will see the current backgrounds and the ones that will be used next time. If you want to select some other backgrounds, just click the shuffle icon and new backgrounds will be chosen randomly for the next change. If you don't want to wait, click the play button and the backgrounds will be changed immediately.
